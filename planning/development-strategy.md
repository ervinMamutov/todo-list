<!--

  There will be different types of tasks for each user story:
    `type: components`
    `type: css`
    `type: logic`
    `type: handlers`
    ...

Development Strategy for Simple Todo List:

1. **Setup and Basic UI**

   - Set up the project structure and initialize a basic user interface (UI)
     with a list container to display tasks.
   - Create input fields for task name, due date, and notes.
   - Implement a button to add new tasks.

2. **Add New Tasks**

   - Implement the functionality to add new tasks when the user enters task
     details and clicks the "Add" button.
   - Validate the input fields to ensure required information is provided (e.g.,
     task name).
   - Append the new task to the list container with all relevant details.

3. **Mark Tasks as Completed**

   - Add a checkbox or a button next to each task in the list to mark it as
     completed.
   - Implement the logic to toggle the completed status of a task when the
     checkbox/button is clicked.
   - Update the UI to visually indicate completed tasks.

4. **Delete Tasks**

   - Add a delete button (e.g., trash icon) next to each task in the list.
   - Implement the functionality to remove a task from the list when the delete
     button is clicked.

5. **View Task Details**

   - Implement a popup/modal to display task details when a task is clicked in
     the list.
   - Include task name, due date, and notes in the task details view.
   - Ensure the task details are easily dismissible by clicking outside the
     popup/modal or using a close button.

6. **Data Storage**

   - Implement data storage to store tasks locally (e.g., using browser's
     localStorage) to persist the tasks across page reloads.
   - Load and display previously added tasks when the page is reloaded.

7. **Accessibility and User Feedback**

   - Ensure the app is accessible and usable for all users, including those with
     disabilities.
   - Provide appropriate error messages and user feedback for actions like
     adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks.

8. **Styling and Responsiveness**

   - Apply CSS styling to make the UI visually appealing and user-friendly.
   - Ensure the todo list is responsive and works well on different screen sizes
     and devices.

9. **Testing and Bug Fixing**

   - Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
   - Test the app on different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.

10. **Documentation and Deployment**
    - Provide clear documentation for the codebase, explaining the app's
      structure and functionality.
    - Deploy the app to a hosting platform to make it accessible online.
